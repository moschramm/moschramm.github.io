# About

Hi, my name is Moritz and I'm doing my Master's studies in Computational Modeling and Simulation at TU Dresden.
Currently, I'm doing a Research Project in the [Schroder Group](https://tu-dresden.de/cmcb/biotec/forschungsgruppen/schroeder?set_language=en) at the Biotechnology Center.
My goal is to do *Relation Extraction (RE)* on biomedical text with focus on drug-gene-relations.
I write this blog to record and structure my progress while I learn the ropes of the field of Language Models.
